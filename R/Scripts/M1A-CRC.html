<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Background</h1>
<p>Approximately 15 % of colorectal carcinomas (CRC) display high level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) due to either a germline mutation in one of the genes responsible for DNA mismatch repair or somatic inactivation of the same pathway <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Guinney:2015aa">1</a>]</span>. MSI is defined using the five primary microsatellite loci recommended at the 1997 National Cancer Institute-sponsored conference on MSI for the identification of MSI or replication errors in colorectal cancer <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Boland:1998aa">2</a>]</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 mononucleotide repeat markers: BAT25 and BAT26</li>
<li>3 dinucleotide repeat markers: D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250</li>
</ul>
<p>Tumors are characterized as MSI-H if two or more of the five markers show instability (i.e., have insertion/deletion mutations) and MSI-L if only one of the five markers shows instability. Note that the distinction between MSI-L and MSS can only be accomplished if a greater number of markers is utilized. MSS and MSI CRC may have different prognoses and response to treatment.</p>
</div>
<div id="outline" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Outline</h1>
<p>In this vignette we will download gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus web site <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">GEO</a> which have MSI status as part of clinical sample charactistics and use these data to illustrate some gene expression data analysis steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Preprocessing.</li>
<li>Building a classifier to predict microsatellite instability status based on gene expression profiles.</li>
<li>Discovering new sub-classes among CRC samples.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main objectives of this vignette are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to demonstrate the use of R markdown to ensure reproducible research, and</li>
<li>to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the <code>caret</code> R package.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> R package greatly facilitates the use of R markdown to integrate data analysis and report writing into a single process. This entire report, including all data downloads and processing can be reproduced by running a single R markdown script. Some of the data analysis steps may be time comsuming, but <code>kntr</code> provides easy ways to deal with these contingencies through neat caching capabilities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html">caret</a> R package provides a extensive set of tools for predictive modeling. A very large selection of modeling approaches can be invoked through a common interface and tools facilitate the process of implementing data splitting schemes to enable hyper-parameter tuning through cross-validation and to produce reliable and comparable model performance estimates.</p>
<div id="data-preprocessing" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p>An important consideration when assembling a dataset for use in analyses aimed at answering scientific questions is how the data should pre-processed. One of the main objectives of the pre-processing step is to remove technical variability without removing the biological variability of interest. Some of the technical variability that affects microarraty gene expression data are sample to sample variability due to differences in starting material quality and sample preparation effects. These sources of variablity are commonly handled by a pre-processing step known as <em>normalization</em>. Even after normalization, some shared variability may be present. This shared variability may be due to samples being processed at different time points, in different labs, using different instruments, etc. These effects are commonly referred to as <em>batch effects</em>. Options to remove batch effects include <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Lazar:2013aa">3</a>]</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantile normalization <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Bolstad:2003aa">4</a>]</span> (the baseline approach, which doesn’t truly address batch effects)</li>
<li>RUV method <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Gagnon-Bartsch:2012aa">5</a>]</span></li>
<li>sva method <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Leek:2012aa">6</a>]</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting the method of normalization and batch correction that is most appropriate for a given problem requires careful analysis. It is helpful to follow proper experimental design practices when collecting the data including:</p>
<ul>
<li>processing the samples in a manner that avoids confounding batching and biological effects</li>
<li>incorporating controls in the dataset, both positive and negative at both the sample and gene level</li>
</ul>
<p>In this analysis we will simply use quantile normalization to renormalize the data after pooling across datasets and verify that egregious batch effects are not present. We could subsequently repeat this analysis using a more sophisticated form of normalization and batch correction and assess the benefits that it brings to the analysis results. Such an assessment is never trivial.</p>
</div>
<div id="affymetrix-probe-sets-vs-genes" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Affymetrix Probe Sets vs Genes</h2>
<p>Affymetrix expression data are organized in probe sets which target genes <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Irizarry:2003aa">7</a>]</span>. There may be several probe sets for a given gene and the association between the two also depends on which gene annotation is used (eg. HUGO vs Entrez). Probe sets which target a given gene sometimes yield discordant gene expression estimates making reducing the probe set data to gene level estiamtes somewhat problematic. For these reasons, we will use the probe set as a gene expression unit of analysis here. This should not affect classification or clustering performance. When it comes to the intrepretation of a particular predictive model, we can bring in the gene annotation associated with each probe set at this point without (much) loss of generality.</p>
<p>We should also note that some probe sets are known to cross-hybridize or not hybridize specifically to the targeted gene’s genomic sequence. We will not pre-filter genes based on this information.</p>
</div>
<div id="building-a-classifier" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Building a Classifier</h2>
<p>Following pre-processing, the pooled dataset will be used to investigate the performance of various classification methods to predict msi status from gene expression data. The pooled dataset will then be split into <strong>Train</strong> and <strong>Test</strong> subsets. Following the split, the <strong>Test</strong> subset is to be excluded from all analyses until we are ready to evaluate the final selection of predictive models under consideration. During the analysis, the <strong>Train</strong> dataset will be further sub-divided into <strong>Fit</strong> and <strong>Validation</strong> subsets for the purpose of model selection and hype-parameter tuning. The Test set is not interrogated until the final model assessment step to ensure that it provides a reliable set of data to assess the performance of the predcitive models. When the size of the dataset is small, it is tempting to rely on cross-validated measures of performance instead of a Test set. We will compare the two measures in this exercise to see if they lead to different orderings of the classifiers or drastically different measures of performance.</p>
<p>When analyzing gene expression data for classification purposes, or to extract biologically meaningful gene signatures, it is customary to first subset genes. The primary reason for this subsetting step is for computational purposes - including all of the genes in the analysis may require too much memory or computing time for some steps. A common approach used is to apply a gene expression variability threshold for genes to be included in the analysis - genes that show little variability across samples are excluded. Since our computing resources are limited, we will apply a fairly aggressive filter to the data. We will reduce the data size by keeping only the 25% most variable genes for all subsequent analyses. In practice, one would be more careful about applying this filter.</p>
</div>
<div id="classifier-assessment" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Classifier Assessment</h2>
<p>Many factors can be incorporated into classifier performance assessment, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predictive performance: Several metrics can be used to quantify predictive performance <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Vihinen:2012aa">8</a>]</span> and the choice is very much context dependent.</li>
<li>Classifier cost: Some classifiers may achieve higher predictive performance but at a cost of requiring a more complete set of predictors or features. This cost may be an important factor in some applications.</li>
<li>Classifier interpretability: In some cases, the main purpose of building a classifier may be to get some insight into the biology at work. Classifiers which implicitly or explicitly perform some sort of feature selection may provide an advantage in terms of interpretability over classifiers which rely on all features in manner that makes it difficult to determine feature importance.</li>
</ul>
<p>For illustration purposes, we will report several measures of predictive performance. We will also comment on each classifier’s cost and interpretability.</p>
</div>
<div id="subclass-discovery" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Subclass Discovery</h2>
<p>In some cases, one may be interested in analyzing gene expression data to uncover subgroups among the sampled population. This is one application of what it known as <em>cluster analysis</em>. To evaluate the performance of cluster analysis methods for the purpose of subclass discovery, we will treat the msi status as unknown and examine each method’s ability to recover this grouping in an unsupervised manner.</p>
<p>We note in passing that in practice this application requires particularly careful normalization and batch effect correction. On the one hand, not removing systematic effects may lead samples to cluster in a way that will make uncovering biologocal clusters very challenging. On the other hand, the batch effect correction method may erroneously remove biological effects in the data.</p>

Primary tumors were obtained at the time of surgical resection, then they were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at -80C, embedded in optimum cutting temperature freezing media (Miles Scientific, Naperville, IL), cryotome sectioned, stained with H&amp;E, and evaluated by a surgical pathologist. Areas with &gt;70% tumor cellularity were identified for RNA isolation. Selected sections of tumor samples were homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and total cellular RNA was purified according the instructions of the manufacturer, with additional purification using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA quality was assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and samples were included only if the 18S and 28S bands were discrete and approximately equal.   biotin      The RNA samples were labeled with IVT labelling kit according to manufacturer's instructions.   9606        Standard Affymetrix procedures   Standard Affymetrix procedures   amplified using Nugen WT-Ovation™   Expression levels were measured in two batches using Affymetrix U133A and U133A Plus 2.0 arrays (Santa Clara, CA). Expression analyses were carried out in the R-software using the package Bioconductor. Expression data in both batches were first subjected for quality assessment by creating the density plot of the log-intensity and RNA degradation plot corresponding to each sample. After preprocessing and quality assessment the two batches were aligned. Probes of the U133A array present in the U133A Plus 2.0 were selected and quantile normalized to mimic the distribution of the U133A array. Five samples had been hybridize in both arrays and served to verify that the correlation of the expression was adequate for the majority of the probes. A total of 331 samples and 419,473 probe sets were subjected to further analysis. Two class comparison of MSI versus MSS tumors were carried out by two-sample t-test to yield a list of differentially expressed probe sets, discriminating between the two biologic states of interest under consideration. We had information on MSI status available from 300 patients and the data set was subsequently reduced to this 300 patients. Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.   For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.

Primary tumors were obtained at the time of surgical resection, then they were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at -80C, embedded in optimum cutting temperature freezing media (Miles Scientific, Naperville, IL), cryotome sectioned, stained with H&amp;E, and evaluated by a surgical pathologist. Areas with &gt;70% tumor cellularity were identified for RNA isolation. Selected sections of tumor samples were homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and total cellular RNA was purified according the instructions of the manufacturer, with additional purification using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA quality was assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and samples were included only if the 18S and 28S bands were discrete and approximately equal.   biotin      The RNA samples were labeled with IVT labelling kit according to manufacturer's instructions.   9606        Standard Affymetrix procedures   Standard Affymetrix procedures   amplified using Nugen WT-Ovation™   Expression levels were measured in two batches using Affymetrix U133A and U133A Plus 2.0 arrays (Santa Clara, CA). Expression analyses were carried out in the R-software using the package Bioconductor. Expression data in both batches were first subjected for quality assessment by creating the density plot of the log-intensity and RNA degradation plot corresponding to each sample. After preprocessing and quality assessment the two batches were aligned. Probes of the U133A array present in the U133A Plus 2.0 were selected and quantile normalized to mimic the distribution of the U133A array. Five samples had been hybridize in both arrays and served to verify that the correlation of the expression was adequate for the majority of the probes. A total of 331 samples and 419,473 probe sets were subjected to further analysis.

<p>Following a peek into the datasets, we will proceed forward keeping only the datasets which used the HG-U133_Plus_2 gene chip (N=54675 probe sets) and have msi status: GSE13067, GSE13294, GSE35896, GSE39084, GSE4554</p>
<p>We exclude GSE75316 from the analysis as most of the samples are already part of GSE13067 and the latter is a larger set.</p>
<p>In the next chunk, we go through each of these datasets and store the gene expression and sample description data in a uniform manner to facilitate subsequent pooling. We also take a look at potential intra dataset batch effects.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Data Pooling</h2>
<p>When pooling data from different sources, we should make sure not to introduce batch effects into the mix. In the first instance we will simply pool the data sets together, and apply quantile normalization. This can be seen as a very weak form of batch effect correction and is a minimal requirement.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Batch Correction</h2>
<p>We see a definite batch effect in the PCA plot based on the pooled expression data. The clustering is along probe set reduction method, RMA vs MAS 5.0. One should reslly go back to the cel files and re-anlyze all samples using one probe set reduction method. For the sake of illustration, we will instead try to remove this effect using a batch-effect correction method.</p>
<p>Given that we don’t have a good set of control genes as required by the RUV method, we’ll use ’ComBat` from the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sva.html">SVA</a> package.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could keep keep the two sets of data, those siummarized using RMA and those summarized using MAS 5.0, separate, alternating using one set for model selection and fitting and the other for testing. This would provide a string test of the generalizability and robustness of the results.</p>

<p>Visual inpection of the effect of the batch correction transformation is a minimal requirement for verification. One can do a better job at quantifying the effect of batch correction, especially of the data set contains control features and control samples.

<p>We will separate the data set into <strong>Train</strong> and <strong>Test</strong> subsets here, before any other filtering or data manipulation. In particular, since we will be interested in evaluating the effect of gene or probe set selection this selection must be made on the basis of the training subset only. This is done as a precautionary measure as gene selection based on variability is unlikely to have an effect on sample classification performance.</p>
<p>Take note that the expression matrices that we save here will be transposed with <code>genes in columns</code>. This is done to accumulate the data format expected by the <code>caret</code> package.</p>

<p>Note that we select genes based on variability in the entire training dataset which includes data from different GEO data sets.

<p>We will use the Top10VarGenes gene set in this analysis. Model tuning and optimization will be done based on 10 repetitions of 5-fold cross-validations. This provides 10 cross-validated, or out-of-sample, predicted values for each sample in the training set. The distribution of predicted values can be examined to identify hard to predict samples. Some of these samples may potentially be mis-labelled, or may be hard to fit for other reasons. One might consider doing an analysis which exludes these samples from the training set to see what impact they have on the fits.</p>
<p>Some of the models which can be evaluated with <code>caret</code> include:</p>

Method requiring explicit dimensionality reduction:
* dlda, lda, qda - Classical linear disrimanent alalysis preceded  by variable selection

Methods which are not adapted to classification problems (penalized regression methods):
* pls - Partial least squares
* lasso - The lasso
* enet - Elastic net

These methods dont work.
* rda - Regularized discriminant analysis
* multinom - Logistic/Multinomial regression
* nnet - neural network

<p>The <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/PAM/">nearest shrunken centriod</a> method described in Tibshirani et. al.

<div id="lack-of-agreement-with-literature-gene-sets" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.2</span> Lack of agreement with literature gene sets</h3>
<p>The variable importance assessment shows that the genes which are deemed important in the clsssifiers the we fitted have little overlap with the gene sets previously identified as being associated with MSS status. Part of this lack of overlap is certanly due to the gene selection filter which we applied here for computing purposes. This not a problem if we just want to build a classifier which predicts well. It is somewhat of a problem if we want to use biology to validate our empirically determined models. In that respect, the lack of agreement of gene lists across analyses is always a problem to contend with.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.3</span> Models could be better optimized</h3>
<p>Note that we did not attempt to optimize the model tuning parameters in any way and just used the default search grids for each model. While this may be a good choice on average, better performance could be obtained from some of the models by specifying a tuning parameter space which is better suited to the problem at hand. This requires a good understanding of each model and is beyond the scope of this vignette.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Cluster Analysis</h1>
<p>In some cases one may be interested in discovering sugroups of samples within the sampled population which are more homogenious than the popolation as a whole. Verhaak et. al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Verhaak:2010aa">25</a>]</span> describe an analysis pipeline for cluster discovery consisting of the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Data collection and integration</li>
<li>Identification of gene-expression based sub-types by cluster analysis</li>
<li>Marker gene signature identification</li>
<li>Clustering validation and assessment of clinical significance</li>
</ol>
<p>In this section we will illustrate the cluster analysis step with two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clustering based on partitioning around medoids (PAM) along with bootstrap aggregating (or Bagging).<br />
</li>
<li>t-SNE</li>
</ul>
<p>The PAM algorithm for clustering is described in detail in Kaufman and Rousseeuw <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Kaufmann:1990aa">26</a>]</span>. t-SNE is described in <a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/">here</a>, with some illustrations <a href="http://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We will treat the MSS/MSI status of samples in our data set as unknown and see if the clustering algorithms can <em>discover</em> these hidden classes. A more interesting problem on the biological pint of view would be to try to <strong>discover</strong> truly unknown subgroups within the MSS and the MSI groups.</p>
<div id="the-pam-clustering-algorithm" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>The PAM Clustering Algorithm</h4>
<p>The PAM algorithm for clustering has some desirable attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the algorithm provides a way of estimating the number of clusters present in the data</li>
<li>each point is assigned to a cluster and a measure of strength or confidence in the cluster assignment is provided for each individual observation</li>
<li>cluster homogeneity can be assessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Underlying the PAM algorithm is a notion of similarity or proximity. Basically, the PAM clustering algorithm sorts out a set of samples into subgroups such that within each subgroup, samples are more similar to other members of the subgroup than to samples assigned to other subgroups.</p>
<p>To define the notion of proximity, suppose the gene expression indicators are stored in a matrix <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with entries <span class="math inline">\(x_{ij}\)</span> being the gene expression indicator on log base 2 scale for sample i gene j. Similarity among samples can be encapsulated by any of a number of measures of distance between the rows of the matrix <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Some common choices are the Euclidean distance (average coordinate squared difference), the Manhattan distance (average coordinate absolute difference), and a suitably transformed measure of correlation (2 – Pearson correlation, for example). More generally, any weighted average of a coordinate specific measure of similarity can be used as a measure of sample similarity.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that for any fixed choice of distance quite different clustering results can be obtained depending on the selection of genes, or probe sets, used to compute the sample to sample distances. This is important to note because it is often necessary to apply a screen to subset genes or probe sets at the outset. This is sometimes done to improve the computing efficiency of the analysis process. Our experience with these data shows that if no screening is applied and all 50K+ probe sets are used to compute sample similarity measures, the clustering procedures are unable to detect even obvious structure in the data – the distinction between MSS and MSI samples, for example. In this analysis, we applied a fairly aggressive screen based on the overall data set variability of expression indicators. It might be advisable to apply the variability constraint to <strong>within data set variability</strong> to avoid selecting probe sets that may have high overall variability due to between data set artifactual variation. This wasn’t done here.</p>
<p>Having computed a distance or dissimilarity matrix, the PAM algorithm proceeds iteratively as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For fixed k (pre-specified number of clusters), select k representative samples arbitrarily.<br />
</li>
<li>Each sample of the data set is assigned to the nearest medoid.<br />
</li>
<li>Update medoids by minimizing the objective function<br />
Repeat steps 2-3 until there is no further change.</li>
</ol>
<p>To measure confidence in the cluster assignment for each sample, and to get a sense of cluster homogeneity, the notion of silhouette is used. The silhouette score is a normalized score: <span class="math display">\[s_i = \frac{b_i – a_i}{max(a_i, b_i)}\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> = average distance between sample i and all other samples within the cluster i is assigned to, and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> = minimum average distance between sample i and samples in other clusters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individual clusters can be characterized by average silhouette width. The clustering or partitioning of a dataset can be summarized by the overall average silhouette width and his can be used to select the number of clusters, k, that best describes the structure in the data set.</p>
<!-- 
Multidimensional scaling can be used to get a two-dimensional representation of the sample data points such that distances on the dimensional plane are good approximations of the actual distances in the original gene space. The scatter-plot on the right panel of Figure F1 is an example of a two-dimensional representation of the sample data.  In the scatter-plot, cluster assignment is indicated by the plotting character.  The ellipses that overlay the scatter-plot are minimum area ellipsoids that contain all of the samples in each cluster.

<h4>Bootstrap Aggregating of Clusters</h4>
<p>The application of bagging to clustering is discussed in Dudoit and Fridlyand <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Dudoit:2003aa">27</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Bootstrap aggregation entails performing the clustering analysis repeatedly on bootstrap subsets of samples – sample sets resulting from randomly selecting samples from the original set of samples. The clustering results for the bootstrap samples are then pooled, or aggregated, to produce the final clustering results. Two methods of aggregation are proposed in Dudoit and Fridlyand <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Dudoit:2003aa">27</a>]</span>. One method (BagClust1) allocates samples to clusters according to a voting scheme. The other method (BagClust2) uses the relative frequency across bootstrap samples with which sample pairs are clustered together as a new measure of distance which is then used by the PAM algorithm to cluster the samples. In our exploration we have found the two approaches to give rise to comparable results. We find the latter to be preferable as the distance matrix used for aggregating the bootstrap clustering results can be used like any other distance matrix to assess confidence in sample assignments and overall clustering homogeneity.</p>
<p>Alternative methods of bagging clusters exist.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/SimonRaper/buster">buster</a> is an R package which implements some form of bagging of hierarchical clustering results. Li <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Li:2011aa">28</a>]</span> discusses a bagged clustering algorithm which is resistent to outliers and scalable.</p>

<p>The groupings discovered by BagClust2 are essentially the same as those discovered by the PAM cluster analysis. The main effect of the bagging is to reduce noise and provide better separation between groups, which greatly increases our confidence in the groupings.</p>
<p>Next we look at the application of t-SNE algorithm to this problem.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> t-SNE</h2>
<p>t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction techique that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. Here we will use the t-SNE algorithm to reduce the gene expression data martrix to a few dimensions. These will then be used as inputs to some clustering algorithm for the purpose of discovering subgroups in the data. Here we will assess the benefit of the t-SNE embedding by repeating the cluster analysis above - PAM and BagClust2 clustering - using the t-SNE embedding as input instead of the scales expression matrix.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Cluster Analysis: Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The PAM algorithm does a decent job at “discovering” the MSS vs MSI grouping in an unsupervised analysis of the gene expression vectors. In this analysis, we restricted the analysis to the Top10VarGenes gene set. A different gene selection might give rise to sligthly different results.</p></li>
<li><p>Bootstrap aggregation of PAM clustering results leads to cleaner separation among the groups but very little difference in the allocation of samples to groups. This is as expected. Bagging in thise case is a noise reduction measure.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying the t-SNE algorithm to extract low dimensional embeddings of the gene expression vectors and applying the PAM algorthim to these data leads to some improved clustering results: separation of the groups is larger than is the results of applying PAM directly to the gene expression data.</p></li>
<li><p>Bootstrap aggregation of results of applying PAM clustering to t-SNE embeddings leads to improved separation between groups and a slight improvement in the coherence between clusters and MSS vs MSI labels.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It appears that both t-SNE embeddings and bootstrap aggregation are helpful in producing better separated clusters in this context. We have only skimmed the surface of cluster analysis of gene expression data in this vignette. We did not look at the propensity of the different approaches to produce fals positive results - the appearance of clusters when non exist. We also did not investigate the effect of the choice of value for the many parameters that can be adjusted in these analyses. In any given situation, the sensitivity of results produced by a method to changes in parameter settings or slight perturbations of the data is an important part of cluster analysis.</p>
